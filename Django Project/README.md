Portfolio project using django

Here my project name is portfolio and app name is main. If you use this code, make sure to edit with your app and project names

I have only uploaded the files which need to be edited. you can keep other files as default if you create a new project and app.

To see how this app looks, head --> https://navinjethwani.pythonanywhere.com

nav-bar isn't still responsive to mobile/tablet screens, so also head --> https://navinjethwani.pythonanywhere.com/projects
